        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="summary">
          As a graduate from the University of Central Florida with a B.S.B.A.
          in Integrated Business, I have taken multiple courses concerning
          Marketing, as well as, Accounting, Business Finance, and Management
          Information Systems. With eight years of work experience, I have been
          able to develop crucial soft skills. I get along very well with the
          people I work with, have great communication skills, and excel in both
          critical thinking, and problem solving in a professional environment.
          I gained marketing experience at a company called Multicom, where I
          have been a Product Manager since 2016. My responsibilities included
          B2B sales, selling our products on Amazon, managing our website,
          writing press release articles, as well as both social media, and
          various marketing roles. My skills have now extended to programming as
          I develop my skills to become a Full Stack Developer.

          <h3>Marketing</h3>
          <p>
            From writing press release articles on new products to selling
            products on Amazon, my marketing experience has been used to help
            facilitate sales in Multicom and expand our brand recognition. With
            a foundation of B2B sales, my responsibilities and experience have
            grown along with Multicom, Inc.

            base.
